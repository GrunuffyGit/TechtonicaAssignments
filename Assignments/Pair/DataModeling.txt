Exercise 1.
Imagine you are creating a website to organize your personal recipe collection. You want to be able to:

See the recipe name and description
Filter by vegetarian or non-vegetarian recipes
Sort by date added to your collection
Filter by which meal of the day the recipe is for
Track how many times you've made each recipe
Find out which friend gave you this recipe (if any)
Make a data model for this app, and answer the following questions:

Table: Recipes
    id  |  name |  description   |   VegOrNot   |  dateAdded   |  day of week | times made |  friend |
--------+-------+----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------+----------
integer |  text |     text       |    Boolean   |  date        |   text       |   integer  |   text  |

What is the entity? 
    Reciepe
What are the attributes of the entity? 
    id, name, description, VegOrNot, dateAdded, day of week, friend
What is the primary key of the entity? 
    id
What are the data types of the attributes? 
    integer, text, text, boolean, date, text, integer, text
Are there other ways you might model this data?
    Yes, right now it a logical model but we can remodel it to a physical model which is less readable by non technical people.
