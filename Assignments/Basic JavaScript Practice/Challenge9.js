// [Challenge 9] Mutating Objects
// 1.Create an array of objects with at least 2 key value pairs. 
// The objects should all have the same keys, and the array should contain at least 3 objects.
// 2.Create a function that accepts the array of objects as an argument.
// 3.Print the value of the second key in each object to the console. Use dot-notation to access the values.
// 4.After printing the values in step 3, change the values of the second key in every object to something new.
// 5.Prove the change worked by printing the second key in each object to the console, which should show the new value. 
// Use bracket-notation to access the values this time.
