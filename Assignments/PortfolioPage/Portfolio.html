                                        Hello! My name is Gloria. 
                                        A little background of me is that I used to be a manual QA tester.
                                        I took what developers created and get to try to break it, which was really fun.
                                        I got to work closely with them and thought what they were doing cool.
                                        It's exiciting to create something out of nothing. It's kind of like magic! 
                                        I dabbled a little bit into coding in school, such as intro courses, but I never
                                        really had the opertunity to just focus on it. I was working a full time job and after work,
                                        I would be in school trying to earn a degree (unrelated to tech). I was sort of in a runt, until 
                                        my sister told me about Techtonica, a free coding bootcamp for women and binary adults. I'm grateful
                                        for this oppertunity because I can put all my focus on learning to become a full stack software developer
                                        without having to worry about finding resources and other living factors, such as a laptop to work on, meals 
                                        being provided, and etc. I hope in the future, I can give back and contribute to the community while doing
                                        what I enjoy.
